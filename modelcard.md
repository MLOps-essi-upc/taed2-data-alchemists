# Model Card for {{ HEALTH CHAT BOT | default("HEALTH CHAT BOT", true) }}

This model is a chat bot trained to answer health related questions. It is the fine tuned version of the following model: 'ybelkada/falcon-7b-sharded-bf16', on HuggingFace, on a data set with pairs of questions and answers of the subject, also from HuggingFace

{{ model_summary | default("", true) }}

## Model Details

### Model Description

The rationale behind this is to answer mental health related queries that can be factually verified without responding gibberish words.

{{ model_description | default("", true) }}

- **Developed by:** {{ developers | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}
- **Shared by [optional]:** {{ shared_by | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}
- **Model type:** {{ model_type | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}
- **Language(s) (NLP):** {{ language | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}
- **License:** {{ license | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}
- **Finetuned from model [optional]:** {{ finetuned_from | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

### Model Sources [optional]

The model can be found on the followig link. Inside it can also be found the original model the fine tuned version is based on.

- **Repository:** {{ [repo](https://huggingface.co/heliosbrahma/falcon-7b-sharded-bf16-finetuned-mental-health-conversational) | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

## Uses

This model can be used by users that want to know a little bit more about health related issues, such as knowing what a panic atack is.


### Downstream Use [optional]

<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->

{{ downstream_use | default("[More Information Needed]", true)}}

### Out-of-Scope Use

This model is not a replacement por a health professional and should not be used as the only recommendation the user gets.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The model was trained on the dataset which may contain sensitive information related to mental health. It is important to note that while mental health chatbots built using this model can be helpful, they are not a replacement for professional mental health care.

### Recommendations

This model should be used as a complementary tool for medical procedures.

## How to Get Started with the Model
